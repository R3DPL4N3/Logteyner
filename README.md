# Logteyner

**Logteyner** is an open-source Docker security agent that monitors the lifecycle of Docker containers on Linux servers in real-time. It detects critical events such as container starts, stops, and failures, analyzes activity for anomalies, and securely forwards logs to your SIEM platform.

- Captures Docker events with low latency  
- Maintains a whitelist of trusted container images  
- Flags suspicious or unknown container activity  
- Integrates with Harbor registry for image vulnerability insights  
- Sends structured logs to SIEM systems (Splunk, ELK, QRadar, etc.)  
- Lightweight and highly reliable agent  

Designed to enhance the observability of your Docker infrastructure and detect threats before they spread.
